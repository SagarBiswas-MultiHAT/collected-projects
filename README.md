# ASCII Art Generator

This project is an ASCII Art Generator that converts images into ASCII art. The program processes an image and maps its pixel brightness to corresponding ASCII characters to create a visual representation of the image using text.

## Features

- Converts images to ASCII art.
- Supports different levels of detail and character sets.
- Adjustable settings for gamma correction, filtering, and influence.
- Multi-threaded processing for faster conversion.

## Settings

- `setting_url`: URL of the image to be converted.
- `setting_gamma`: Enable or disable gamma correction.
- `setting_filter`: Enable or disable pixel filtering.
- `setting_multi`: Enable or disable multi-threaded processing.
- `setting_influence`: Enable or disable influence-based scoring.
- `setting_simple`: Use a simple character set.
- `setting_random`: Use a full character set with random selection.
- `setting_width`: Width of the output ASCII art.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```sh
./amg-master [options] [image_url]
```

### Options

- `-g`: Disable gamma correction.
- `-f`: Disable pixel filtering.
- `-m`: Disable multi-threaded processing.
- `-i`: Disable influence-based scoring.
- `-s`: Use a simple character set.
- `-r`: Use a full character set with random selection.
- `-w [width]`: Set the width of the output ASCII art.
